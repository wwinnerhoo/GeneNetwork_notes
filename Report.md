# Overview

This script is used to record Python functions that contribute to learning the [GeneNetwork](https://genenetwork.org/).  It mainly includes self-made functions and a hands-on tutorial of the 3rd GeneNetwork Uploader.



## Functions

Useful functions involved in API will be introduced here for beginners. 





## Uploader

[The genotypic (gene expression) and phenotypic (maps) data of C. elegans](http://www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.102160.109) were applied to test the uploader.  A short description of the genotype and phenotype data is: The recombinant inbred lines of *C. elegans* were driven by the wildtypes N2 and CB4856. The phenotype is about the lifespan per recombinant inbred line using the *E.coli (OP50)* as a food source.  The dataset is stored under the parallel folder namely "C.elegans_data", you can also download them by clicking the buttons "Markers" and "Expression data" on the website "https://www.bioinformatics.nl/EleQTL/?mode=correlation".



The website [https://bioart.io/](https://bioart.io/) is a user-friendly interface for uploading personal data. The genotype data should be uploaded with the "Average" option, while phenotype data should be uploaded with the "Standard Error" option. Using the mentioned C.elegans data as an example,  you will find below errors:
